# Hi there！ 嘿大家好！ Salut！
### 👋 This is Steven.
### 💬 English, Mandarin（中文), French（français) are all acceptable for me.
### 🔭 I’m a Second-Year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at McGill University. 
### 🔭 I obtained my Bachelor of Science Degree in Honorous Computer Science at McGill University. 


### 🧐 What truly captivates me is the potential of intelligent systems to assist humans. How can artificial intelligence accurately and flawlessly complete tasks assigned by humans? More specifically, my research is concentrated on (i) addressing the issue of out-of-distribution challenges in Offline Black Box Optimization through the use of proxy functions or conditional generative models, (ii) developing a foundational knowledge model, which involves using a neural network to represent knowledge, extracting information from unstructured text, and filling in missing information in a knowledge base, as well as (iii) improve the efficiency of language model's inference with information compression or knowledge distillation. 
### 💪 My greatest assets are my eagerness to learn new things, my curiosity to delve into uncharted territories, and my drive to stay abreast of the latest developments. 
### 🏭 Beyond academia, I collaborate closely with Microsoft Research Cambridge and Noah’s Ark Lab Montreal.



### 📧 If you have any questions about my projects or have cooperation intentions with me, feel free to contact me via email: ye.yuan3 AT mail DOT mcgill DOT ca
### 💰 I'm seeking research opportunities or internships. Feel free to contact me as well.
