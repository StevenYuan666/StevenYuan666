# Hi there！ 嘿大家好！ Salut！
### 👋 This is Steven.
### 💬 English, Mandarin（中文), French（français) are all acceptable for me.
### 🔭 I’m a Third-Year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at McGill University and Quebec AI Institute-Mila. 
### 🧑‍🏫 It's fortunate to be supervised by Professor [Xue (Steve) Liu](https://cs.mcgill.ca/~xueliu/site/intro.html).
### 📅 It's fortunate to have Professor [Adriana Romero Soriano](https://sites.google.com/site/adriromsor/home) and Professor [Gintare Karolina Dziugaite](https://gkdz.org/) as my supervision committee member.
### 🔭 I obtained my Bachelor of Science Degree in Honorous Computer Science at McGill University. 


### 🧐 What truly captivates me is the potential of intelligent systems and generative modelling to assist humans. How can artificial intelligence accurately and flawlessly complete tasks assigned by humans? How can generative models be applied for specific tasks? How do generative models mitigates the issues suffered by predominately used traditional approaches? More specifically, my research is concentrated on **score-based generative algorithms** and **large language models** with their applications in (i) **addressing the Offline Black Box Optimization challenges**, (ii) **alleviating the challenges of knowledge-centric NLP tasks**, developing a foundational knowledge model, enabling the automatic knowledge base construction, (iii) **improve the efficiency and efficacy of AI systems for real-world applications**.
### 💪 My greatest assets are my eagerness to learn new things, my curiosity to delve into uncharted territories, my drive to stay abreast of the latest developments, and my persistence to work hard.
### 🏭 Beyond academia, I collaborate closely with Microsoft Research, Samsung Research America, RBC Borealis and Noah’s Ark Lab Canada.
